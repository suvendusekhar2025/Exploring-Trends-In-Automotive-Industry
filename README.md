*Project Description
-This project involved performing extensive analysis on a database of car sales information to uncover insights into pricing trends, model performance, and more. The data contained details on car models, pricing history, mileage, transmission types and other attributes.

-I utilized SQL to explore the data and derive insights to guide pricing, inventory and marketing strategies.

*Tasks Performed
-Performed general data exploration and validation checks on the cars dataset

-Analyzed average selling prices by various dimensions like transmission, fuel type, ownership etc. to reveal pricing patterns

-Identified highest mileage models to understand durability and maintenance costs

-Computed price variability within and across models to guide pricing strategy

-Compared pricing and mileage metrics vs overall averages to find outliers

-Generated cumulative price trends over time and YoY comparisons for price forecasting

-Computed complex iterative analytics like moving averages for price smoothing

-Summarized total mileage by transmission for maintenance and repair planning

-Ranked models by selling price and analyzed historical averages for top models

-Used SQL techniques like WINDOW functions, CTEs, JOINs for advanced analysis

-Presented findings in a clear format for consumption by leadership and stakeholders

-Overall, this project enabled me to showcase my SQL skills to derive data-driven insights from car sales data to support key business decisions and strategy.
